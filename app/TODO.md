1. Screenshot capture - Server takes URL, captures screenshot, stores it, returns to parent [[DONE]]
2. Write README file
3. Deploy (Docker Hub image or Railway)
4. Make operations async (optional optimization)
5. Write documentation of endpoints (Swagger auto-generates basics, but custom docs if needed)
6. Consider adding more security to image capture functionality, to hide access-key
7. VERY IMPORTANT: FOR adult Category, no screenshot is captured. For anything else, like gambling or violance, its fine.
