For screenshot, I believe I actually have a pretty elegant way to solve this. "Why I mentioned we should avoid apps for now", the screenshot wont be captured in child's device. Instead, the server will take the url, access the link itself, and capture the screenshot/save it to report. This makes things much more manageable. There's a table I've actually remembered we'd need, "verification_code", because we're required to add two way authentication, and our chosen solution is password 'already added it', and send vc to parent email "No need to do SMS and require phone number, email we already have it/need it". As the others, we should only add what we actually need. Now, where would I add this schema file? In its own folder or what? 
And what's our next step? I believe we should add some test data, and add whatever is necessary to FastAPI/python, to connect to postegres table. Then, we should do quick test, by trying to do some queries to make sure the backend interacts with the database correctly. "One note, I've removed the "ports:
  - "5432:5432" " from docker compose, because my host already uses it and it wont build. Just keep it in mind in case we'd need it, but the app worked fine without it.
Please, help me do all these steps in your response, since they're all related and pretty straightforward, but please explain all the steps necessary because I'm still getting used to professional backend development. ( You don't have to update the files my friend, just give me everything in the message reponse directly, easier for both of us, I can do all the additions myself on the my editor)
